# Fish Diversity Prediction 

This project focuses on predicting fish diversity using Logistic Regression, a machine learning algorithm, with Python. The analysis is performed using a Jupyter Notebook and is based on a dataset provided in a CSV file. The goal is to predict the presence or absence of different fish species in various environments based on environmental factors such as water temperature, pH levels, and more.

## Overview

Fish diversity is crucial for maintaining healthy aquatic ecosystems. By predicting the diversity of fish species in a given environment, we can take proactive steps in conservation and resource management. This project uses logistic regression to model the relationship between environmental factors and fish species diversity.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a CSV file that includes various environmental parameters and the presence or absence of fish species. The columns include features like:

Category, Species, Weight, Height, Width, Length1, Length2, Length3

## Installation

To run the project locally, you'll need to have Python 3.x installed along with the following libraries:

pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

You will also need Jupyter Notebook to run the analysis.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/Varshadas0/fish-diversity-prediction.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd fish-diversity-prediction
```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook
```

4. Open the `Fish_Diversity_Prediction.ipynb` notebook and run the cells to perform the analysis.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes steps to clean and prepare the dataset.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizes and analyzes the data to identify trends and patterns.
- **Logistic Regression Model**: Builds and trains a logistic regression model to predict fish species diversity.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates the model using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and other metrics.

## Results

The model provides insights into which environmental factors most strongly influence fish diversity. The accuracy and other performance metrics are detailed in the notebook.
